### **Image to LaTeX Converter**  

This project enables the conversion of **mathematical equations from images** into **LaTeX code** using **pix2tex**, a deep learning-based OCR model. Users can upload an image, highlight the mathematical portion using an interactive **snipping tool**, and extract the corresponding LaTeX representation.  

### **Key Features:**  
✅ **Image Preprocessing** – Enhances OCR accuracy by applying grayscale conversion, blurring, and thresholding.  
✅ **Automated LaTeX Extraction** – Utilizes **pix2tex** to accurately convert equations into LaTeX format.  
✅ **Interactive Canvas Tool** – Allows users to manually select the equation region for precise extraction.  

Although the system performs well for **basic mathematical expressions**, it may require **further optimization** to improve accuracy for **complex equations** involving intricate symbols and multi-line structures.
